However, unfortunately it is still leaking, at least when the heat pump is turned off (as it needs to be so as to not make the lab get too cold).  I checked this morning.  It was leaking so I put the bowl back under the drip.  The second issue was water dripping from the ceiling onto the acoustic tiles.  This has not been repaired and the water is continuing to drip so the stain on the tiles is continuing to grow.

( as found it was plated over with tin and sealed with duct tape, not sure why this was done?) Removed the tin blocking the hot air vent and reassembled the tiles.

Can we have the schedule changed so that it comes on earlier to correct the temperature before the equipment reaches its critical temperature threshold?

The main door LOCK which open The CALL Facility (CLE A025) front entrance door, continues to be difficult to unlock. It is not the door itself, nor the airflow from the room, as addressed in the previous request. The problem that occurred again this morning is that staff are unable to unlock the door easily. The problem is directly attributable to the lock on the door.     We are requesting replacement of the lock on the door leading into CALL (CLE A025) so that staff can open the door easily on their own. Currently the door can only be opened by more 'force' than should be needed. Staff today were unable to actually unlock the door and had to call for a Supervisor to unlock it.    This lock is probably over 25+ years, perhaps original, and should be replaced with a better lock, but keeping the same key so that we do not have to replace dozens of keys to CALL already assigned to staff.    Currently, there are no classes scheduled in CLE A025, so anytime from Monday-Friday, from 830-430 would be fine.
